# CodeAlpha_Project-1
I'm excited to share my latest project with you—an easy-to-use Age Calculator web app! In this repository, I'll walk you through building a cool and interactive tool that calculates ages based on your birthdate. It’s a fun way to see how we can use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript together. I hope you enjoy it and find it inspiring for your own projects!
